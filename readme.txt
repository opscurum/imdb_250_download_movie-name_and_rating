I wrote the code to download imdb 250 data from internet using Python and BeautifulSoup.
After downloading these movies, we can shoot movies above the desired rating with the inputs received from the user.



Step 1: Install Python
step 2: install from cmd command
                pip install requests
                pip install beatifulsoup4
